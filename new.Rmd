\INTRODUCTION \Background

Calorie is a unit of heat energy. Health and fitness are becoming
increasingly important to individuals and society as a whole. As people
seek to live healthier lifestyles, they are turning to wearable devices
and fitness trackers to monitor their physical activity and track their
progress. One important metric that these devices track is the number of
calories burnt during physical activity. Accurately predicting calorie
burn can help individuals set and achieve fitness goals and can also
inform health coaching and wellness tracking programs . The motivation
for this research is to develop a model that can accurately predict
calorie burn during physical activity. This has potential applications
in a range of settings, including personalized health coaching, fitness
tracking, and wellness programs. By developing an accurate calorie burn
prediction model, we can help individuals make more informed decisions
about their physical activity and improve their overall health and
well-being

\PROJECT OBJECTIVE\

The objective of a calories burned prediction model is to estimate the
number of calories an individual is likely to burn during a specific
physical activity based on various input features. The goal is to create
a model that can accurately predict calorie expenditure, considering
factors such as user characteristics, activity details, and health
metrics.

\*\DATA

The dataset was collected from \*\Kaggle, a popular platform for data
scientists and machine learning practitioners to access and share
datasets.

In this work, the dataset contained over 15,000 records and 7
variables. 1. User_ID: Unique identifier for each user (integer). 2.
Gender: Gender of the user (character: "male" or "female"). 3. Age: Age
of the user (integer). 4. Height: Height of the user (integer). 5.
Weight: Weight of the user (integer). 6. Duration: Duration of the
activity (integer). 7. Heart_Rate: Heart rate of the user during the
activity (integer). 8. Body_Temp: Body temperature of the user during
the activity (numeric). 9. Calories: Number of calories burned during
the activity (integer).

The average height for Indian men is 5.8 feet (177 cm), and that for
women is 5.3 feet (162 cm) the height may differ,they are indeed genuine
data points, it makes sense to retain them.

#OUTLIERS FOR WEIGHT

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Calculate IQR
data=df$Weight
q1 <- quantile(data, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(data, 0.75)

iqr
# Define a threshold for outliers
threshold <- 1.5 * iqr

# Identify outliers
outliers <- data[data < (q1 - threshold) | data > (q3 + threshold)]
outliers
```

Healthy Weight: 65kg to 75kg. Overweight: 75kg to 95kg. Obese: 95kg to
125kg. Very Obese: More than 125kg They are indeed genuine data points,
it makes sense to retain them.these are the weights of obese

#OUTLIERS FOR Heart_rate

outliers
```

A normal resting heart rate should be between 60 to 100 beats per
minute, but it can vary from minute to minute. Our age and general
health can also affect our pulse rate, so it's important to remember
that a 'normal' pulse can vary from person to person. Yes, it's normal
for our heart rate to increase to 130 to 150 beats per minute or more
when we exercise -- this is because your heart is working to pump more
oxygen-rich blood around your body.

#OUTLIERS FOR Body Temperature

```{r echo=TRUE}

The average body temperature is 37 C. A high-grade fever is present when
the oral temperature is above 38.5°C but here we are gettting outliers
below 38.5 ,that is quiet normal so,we will not drop these data points

Linear Regression Linear regression models the relationships between at
least one explanatory variable (independent) and an outcome variable
(dependent). When there is one independent variable, the procedure is
known as simple linear regression.

Simple linear regression: Simple linear regression is defined by the
linear function: Y= β0 + β1X + Ɛ  Y is the predicted value of the
dependent variable (Y) for any given value of the independent variable
(X).  β0 is the intercept, the predicted value of Y when the Xis 0. 
β1is the regression coefficient -- how much we expect Y to change as X
increases.  X is the independent variable.  Ɛis the error of the
estimate, or how much variation there is in our estimate of the
regression coefficient.

Assumption of Data: We can use R to check that our data meet the four
main assumption of linear model.

1.  Independence of observation:The first assumption of linear
    regression is the independence of observations. Independence means
    that there is no relation between the independents variables. We
    find correlation between independents variable and make sure they
    are not too highly correlated. Because we have only one independent
    variable at a time, we don't need to test for any hidden relation
    between them.

2.  Normality: The second assumption of Linear Regression is that the
    residuals should follow a normal distribution. Once you obtain the
    residuals from your model, this is relatively easy to test using
    either a histogram or a QQ Plot. To check whether the dependent
    variable follows the normal distribution we use histogram.

3.  Linearity: The relationship between dependent and independent
    variable must be linear. We can test this visually with a scatter
    plot to see if the distribution of data point could be described
    with a straight line.

4.  Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity in a model means that the error
    is constant along the values of the dependent variable. The best way
    for checking homoscedasticity is to make a scatterplot with the
    residuals against the dependent variable.

Normality: Use the hist() function to test whether our dependent
variable follows a normal distribution

```         
                                     DURATION
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Set up the plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=6)

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Create a density plot using ggplot2
density_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Duration)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightblue", color="red", alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Duration", x="Duration", y="Density")

# Create a histogram using ggplot2
hist_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Duration)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue", color="black", bins=30) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Duration", x="Duration", y="Frequency")

# Arrange the plots in a 1x2 grid
grid.arrange(density_plot, hist_plot, ncol=2)

# Show the plots
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
qqnorm(df$Duration)
qqline(df$Duration, col = 2)
```

Since, qq-plot is not that much close to the actual line , so the
distribution of Duration the data may deviate from a normal
distribution.

S-shaped Curve: An S-shaped curve in the QQ plot may suggest skewness in
the data.

so, we can still proceed with the linear regression

Linearity:We can check this by using scatterplot between Calories and
Duration

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Response = Calories
# Predictor = Duration
 cor(df$Calories,df$Duration)
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(Duration, Calories)) + 
  geom_point(pch = 20, col = "deeppink4", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, col = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Calories", 
       subtitle = "Calories VS Duration") + 
  xlab("Duration") + 
  ylab("Calories") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'snow1'),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'))


```

Comment: Here, The correlation coefficient between Calories and Height
is 0.9554205. Strong positive correlation with calories (0.96).Longer
exercise durations associated with higher calorie burn. From the fitted
scatterplot,the result is also verified.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(df$Calories,df$Duration,main = "Calories v/s  Duration",ylab = "Calories",xlab = "Duration",type = "h")
```

the relationship between Calories and Duration appears linear. We can
proceed with linear regression.

### **Fitting a linear model between Calories vs Duration\$**

```{r echo=TRUE}
model = df %>%
  lm(formula =Calories~Duration)
model %>% summary()
```

#### \*The linear regression model indicates a highly significant and strong relationship between Duration and Calories. Specifically:

Intercept: Predicted Calories when Duration is zero is -21.86, but
interpret cautiously.

Duration (Slope): For each one-unit increase in Duration, predicted
Calories increase by approximately 7.17 units.

Statistical Significance: Both intercept and Duration are highly
significant (p \< 2e-16).

Model Fit: The model explains about 91.28% of the variability in
Calories based on the high R-squared value.

Overall Model Significance: The overall model is statistically
significant, suggesting its usefulness in predicting Calories based on
Duration.

Check for homoscedasticity:

Before proceeding with data visualization, we should make sure that our
models fit the homoscedasticity assumption of the linear model. We
should check that our model is actually a good fit for the data, and
that we don't have large variation in the model error, by running this
code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm(formula =df$Calories~df$Duration))
```

The most important thing to look for is that the red lines representing
the mean of the residuals are all basically horizontal and centered
around zero. This means there are no outliers or biases in the data that
would make a linear regression invalid.

Based on these residuals, we can say that our model meets the assumption
of homoscedasticity.

Visualize the result with graph:

```{r echo=TRUE}

Calories.graph<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Calories, y=Duration))+
 geom_point()
Calories.graph <- Calories.graph + geom_smooth(method="lm", 
col="black")
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
Calories.graph +
 theme_bw() +
 labs(title = "Reported Calories as a function of Duration",
 x = "Duration",
 y = "Calories score")+ 
annotate(geom="text",label="Calories = -21.8597 + (7.1729*Duration)")
```

We found a significant relationship between Calories and Duration, with
a 7.1729-unit increase in reported Calories for every 1 unit increase in
Duration

```         
                                      HEIGHT
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Set up the plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=6)

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Create a density plot using ggplot2
density_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Height)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightblue", color="red", alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Height", x="Height", y="Density")

# Create a histogram using ggplot2
hist_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Height)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue", color="black", bins=30) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Height", x="Height", y="Frequency")

# Arrange the plots in a 1x2 grid
grid.arrange(density_plot, hist_plot, ncol=2)

# Show the plots
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
qqnorm(df$Height)
qqline(df$Height, col = 2)
```

Since, qq-plot is very much close to the actual line , so the
distribution of Height in our data is normally distributed.😊

The distribution of observations is bell-shaped, so we can proceed with
the linear regression

Linearity:We can check this by using scatterplot between Calories and
Height

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Response = Calories
# Predictor = Height
 cor(df$Calories,df$Height)
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(Height, Calories)) + 
  geom_point(pch = 20, col = "deeppink4", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, col = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Calories", 
       subtitle = "Calories VS Height") + 
  xlab("Height") + 
  ylab("Calories") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'snow1'),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'))


```

Comment: Here, The correlation coefficient between Calories and Height
is 0.01753677. That is, there's a weak positive correlation between
these two variables. From the fitted scatterplot,the result
is also verified.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(df$Calories,df$Height,main = "Calories v/s  Height",ylab = "Calories",xlab = "Height",type = "h")
```

Although the relationship between Calories and Height is a bit less
clear, it still appears linear. We can proceed with linear regression.

### **Fitting a linear model between Calories vs Height\$**

```{r echo=TRUE}
model = df %>%
  lm(formula =Calories~Height)
model %>% summary()
```

The linear regression model suggests a statistically significant but
modest relationship between Height and Calories:

Intercept: Predicted Calories when Height is zero is 76.14, but this
might not have practical meaning.

Height (Slope): For each one-unit increase in Height, predicted Calories
increase by approximately 0.077 units.

Statistical Significance: The relationship is statistically significant
(p = 0.0317), but the p-value is higher compared to other models.

Model Fit: The model has limited explanatory power (low R-squared),
indicating that Height explains only a negligible portion of the
variability in Calories.

Overall Model Significance: The overall model is statistically
significant, but the effect size is relatively small.

Conclusion: While statistically significant, the practical impact of
Height on predicting Calories appears limited. Consider exploring
additional factors for a more comprehensive understanding of calorie
prediction

Check for homoscedasticity:

Before proceeding with data visualization, we should make sure that our
models fit the homoscedasticity assumption of the linear model. We
should check that our model is actually a good fit for the data, and
that we don't have large variation in the model error, by running this
code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm(formula =df$Calories~df$Height))
```

The most important thing to look for is that the red lines representing
the mean of the residuals are all basically horizontal and centered
around zero. This means there are no outliers or biases in the data that
would make a linear regression invalid.

Based on these residuals, we can say that our model meets the assumption
of homoscedasticity.

Visualize the result with graph:

```{r echo=TRUE}

Calories.graph<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Calories, y=Height))+
 geom_point()
Calories.graph <- Calories.graph + geom_smooth(method="lm", 
col="black")
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
Calories.graph +
 theme_bw() +
 labs(title = "Reported Calories as a function of Height",
 x = "Height",
 y = "Calories score")+ 
annotate(geom="text",label="Calories = 76.13730 + (0.07682*Height)")
```

We found a significant relationship between Calories and Height, with a
0.07682-unit increase in reported Calories for every 1 unit increase in
Height

```         
                                      Heart_Rate
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Set up the plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=6)

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Create a density plot using ggplot2
density_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Heart_Rate)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightblue", color="red", alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Heart_Rate", x="Heart_Rate", y="Density")

# Create a histogram using ggplot2
hist_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Heart_Rate)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue", color="black", bins=30) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Heart_Rate", x="Heart_Rate", y="Frequency")

# Arrange the plots in a 1x2 grid
grid.arrange(density_plot, hist_plot, ncol=2)

# Show the plots
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
qqnorm(df$Heart_Rate)
qqline(df$Heart_Rate, col = 'red')
```

Since, qq-plot deviates a little from the central line, so the
distribution of Heart_Rate deviates a bit from the normal distribution.

The distribution of observations is bell-shaped, so we can proceed with
the linear regression

Linearity:We can check this by using scatterplot between Calories and
Heart_Rate

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Response = Calories
# Predictor =Heart_Rate
 cor(df$Calories,df$Heart_Rate)

Comment: Here, The correlation coefficient between Calories and
Heart_Rate is 0.8978821. That is, there's a strong positive correlation
between these two variables. From the fitted scatterplot,the result
is also verified.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(df$Calories,df$Heart_Rate,main = "Calories v/s  Heart_Rate",ylab = "Calories",xlab = "Heart_Rate",type = "h")
```

the relationship between Calories and Heart_Rate appears linear. We can
proceed with linear regression.

### **Fitting a linear model between Calories vs Heart_Rate\$**

```{r echo=TRUE}
model = df %>%
  lm(formula =Calories~Heart_Rate)
model %>% summary()
```

The linear regression model indicates a strong and statistically
significant relationship between Heart_Rate and Calories. Specifically:

Intercept: The estimated intercept is -469.41, representing the
predicted Calories when Heart_Rate is zero. Interpretation of the
intercept may not be meaningful in our context.

Heart_Rate: For each one-unit increase in Heart_Rate, the predicted
Calories increase by approximately 5.85 units.

Statistical Significance: Both intercept and Heart_Rate coefficients are
highly significant (p \< 2e-16), providing strong evidence against the
null hypothesis that their values are zero.

Model Fit: The model explains about 80.62% of the variability in
Calories based on the R-squared value. The residuals have a standard
deviation of 27.5, indicating the typical difference between observed
and predicted values.

Overall Model Significance: The F-statistic is very high (6.239e+04)
with a small p-value (\<2.2e-16), indicating that the overall model is
statistically significant.

Conclusion: The linear regression model is a robust predictor of
Calories based on Heart_Rate, and the strong statistical significance
supports the assertion that the relationship is meaningful in the data.

\*Check for homoscedasticity:

Before proceeding with data visualization, we should make sure that our
models fit the homoscedasticity assumption of the linear model. We
should check that our model is actually a good fit for the data, and
that we don't have large variation in the model error, by running this
code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm(formula =df$Calories~df$Heart_Rate))
```

Based on these residuals, we can say that our model meets the assumption
of homoscedasticity.

Visualize the result with graph:

```{r echo=TRUE}

Calories.graph<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Calories, y=Heart_Rate))+
 geom_point()
Calories.graph <- Calories.graph + geom_smooth(method="lm", 
col="black")
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
Calories.graph +
 theme_bw() +
 labs(title = "Reported Calories as a function of Heart_Rate",
 x = "Heart_Rate",
 y = "Calories score")+ 
annotate(geom="text",label="Calories = -469.40865 + (5.85172*Heart_Rate)")
```

We found a significant relationship between Calories and Heart_Rate.

```         
                                      BODY TEMPERATURE
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Set up the plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=6)

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Create a density plot using ggplot2
density_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Body_Temp)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightblue", color="red", alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Body temperature", x="Body_Temp", y="Density")

# Create a histogram using ggplot2
hist_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Body_Temp)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue", color="black", bins=30) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Height", x="Body_Temp", y="Frequency")

# Arrange the plots in a 1x2 grid
grid.arrange(density_plot, hist_plot, ncol=2)

# Show the plots
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
qqnorm(df$Body_Temp)
qqline(df$Body_Temp, col = 2)
```

Since, qq-plot deviates a little from the central line, so the
distribution of Body_Temp deviates a bit from the normal distribution.😓

The distribution of observations is approximately bell-shaped, so we can
proceed with the linear regression

Linearity:We can check this by using scatterplot between Calories and
Body_Temp

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Response = Calories
# Predictor = Body_Temp
 cor(df$Calories,df$Body_Temp)
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(Body_Temp, Calories)) + 
  geom_point(pch = 20, col = "deeppink4", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, col = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Calories", 
       subtitle = "Calories VS Body_Temp") + 
  xlab("Body_Temp") + 
  ylab("Calories") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'snow1'),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'mistyrose'))


```

Comment: Here, The correlation coefficient between Calories and Height
is 0.8245578. That is, there's a strong positive correlation between
these two variables. From the fitted scatterplot,the result
is also verified.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(df$Calories,df$Height,main = "Calories v/s  Body_Temp",ylab = "Calories",xlab = "Body_Temp",type = "h")
```

Although the relationship between Calories and Height is a bit less
clear, it still appears linear. We can proceed with linear regression.

### **Fitting a linear model between Calories vs Body_Temp\$**

```{r echo=TRUE}
model = df %>%
  lm(formula =Calories~Body_Temp)
model %>% summary()
```

The linear regression model indicates a highly significant and strong
relationship between Body_Temp and Calories:

Intercept: Predicted Calories when Body_Temp is zero is -2555.75, but
interpret cautiously.

Body_Temp (Slope): For each one-unit increase in Body_Temp, predicted
Calories increase by approximately 66.09 units.

Statistical Significance: Both intercept and Body_Temp are highly
significant (p \< 2e-16).

Model Fit: The model explains about 67.99% of the variability in
Calories based on the high R-squared value.

Overall Model Significance: The overall model is statistically
significant, suggesting its usefulness in predicting Calories based on
Body_Temp.

The linear regression model is highly significant, suggesting a strong
and meaningful relationship between Body_Temp and Calories. The high
R-squared value indicates that a substantial portion of the variability
in Calories is explained by the linear relationship with Body_Temp. This
model can be used to predict Calories based on body temperature.

Check for homoscedasticity:

Before proceeding with data visualization, we should make sure that our
models fit the homoscedasticity assumption of the linear model. We
should check that our model is actually a good fit for the data, and
that we don't have large variation in the model error, by running this
code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm(formula =df$Calories~df$Body_Temp))
```

Based on these residuals, we can say that our model meets the assumption
of homoscedasticity.

Visualize the result with graph:

```{r echo=TRUE}

Calories.graph<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Calories, y=Body_Temp))+
 geom_point()
Calories.graph <- Calories.graph + geom_smooth(method="lm", 
col="black")
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
Calories.graph +
 theme_bw() +
 labs(title = "Reported Calories as a function of Body_Temp",
 x = "Body_Temp",
 y = "Calories score")+ 
annotate(geom="text",label="Calories = -2555.7468 + (66.0901*Body_Temp)")
```

We found a significant relationship between Calories and Body
temperature, with a 66.0901-unit increase in reported Calories for every
1 unit increase in Body temperature.

\*\CONCLUSION

Practical Recommendations:

For individuals aiming to maximize calorie burn, focusing on activities
with longer durations, increased heart rates, and elevated body
temperatures could prove beneficial
